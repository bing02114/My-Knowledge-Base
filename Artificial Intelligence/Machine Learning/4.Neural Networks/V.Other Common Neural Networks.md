### 1.RBF Networks

>A single-hidden-layer feedforward neural network that uses a radial basis function as the hidden layer activation function

$$\varphi(x)=\sum^{q}_{i=1}w_{i}\rho(x,c_{i})$$

### 2.ART Networks

>A competitive learning network where output neurons compete, with only one winning neuron activated at any time ("winner-take-all"). It can perform incremental learning, allowing it to learn new knowledge while retaining old knowledge

### 3.SOM Networks

>An unsupervised competitive learning network that maps high-dimensional input data to a low-dimensional space (typically 2D) while preserving the data's topological structure.

### 4.Cascade-Correlation Networks

>A structurally self-adapting network that starts with a minimal topology and adds new hidden neurons during training, creating a hierarchical structure

### 5.Elman Networks

>A type of recurrent neural network (RNN) where the output of hidden layer neurons is fed back to become part of the input for the next time step, enabling it to process time-related dynamic data.

### 6.Boltzman Machines

>An energy-based model with visible and hidden layers. The network reaches its ideal state when its "energy" function is minimized. The Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) is a common variant where connections only exist between the visible and hidden layers, not within them.
