#### 1.1 Row and Column Pictures

**The Fundamental Problem: The Geometry of Linear Equations**

>The fundamental problem of linear algebra is to **solve a system of n linear equations with n unknowns**

**The Row Picture: Intersection of Planes**

>In the row picture, each equation represents a line (2D) or a plane (3D)
>
>The solution to the system is the point where these lines or planes intersect
