### 1.Hand Calculation of Policy Evaluation

#### 1.1 (a)

$$V^{\pi}(s)=\sum_{a\in A}\pi(a|s)\sum_{s',r}P(s',r|s,a)[r+\gamma V^{\pi}(s')]$$

$$V^{\pi}(s_{1})=0.7(0.8(2+0.9V^{\pi}(s_{1}))+0.2(5+0.9V^{\pi}(s_{2}))) +0.3(0.3(1+0.9V^{\pi}(s_{1}))+0.7(3+0.9V^{\pi}(s_{2})))$$
$$=2.54+0.585V^{\pi}(s_{1})+0.315V^{\pi}(s_{2})$$

$$V^{\pi}(s_{2})=0.4(0.6(4+0.9V^{\pi}(s_1))+0.4(1+0.9V^{\pi}(s_2)))+0.6(0.1(0+0.9V^{\pi}(s_1))+0.9(2+0.9V^{\pi}(s_2)))$$

$$=2.2+0.27V^{\pi}(s_{1})+0.63V^{\pi}(s_{2}$$

#### 1.2

$$V_{1}(s_1)=2.54+0.585V_{0}(s_1)+0.315V_{0}(s_2)=2.54$$
$$V_{1}(s_2)=2.2+0.27V_{0}(s_1)+0.63V_{0}(s_2)=2.2$$
$$V_2(s_1)=2.54+0.585V_1(s_1)+0.315V_{1}(s_2)=4.72$$
$$V_{2}(s_2)=2.2+0.27V_{1}(s_1)+0.63V_{1}(s_2)=4.27$$
