### 1.Definition

>Clustering is a primary task in "unsupervised learning," where training samples have no labels. It aims to partition a dataset into several disjoint subsets, called "clusters."

### 2.Goal

>Ideally, each cluster corresponds to some underlying concept or category. The process automatically forms these cluster structures, and the semantic meaning of each cluster needs to be interpreted by the user.

### 3.Formalization

>For a sample set D={x1​,...,xm​}, a clustering algorithm partitions it into _k_ clusters {C1​,...,Ck​}. The result can be represented by a cluster label vector λ=(λ1​,...,λm​), where λj​ is the cluster label for sample xj​.
