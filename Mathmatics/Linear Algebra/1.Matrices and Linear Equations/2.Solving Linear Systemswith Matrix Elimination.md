### 1. Matrix Elimination

#### 1.1 The Process of Elimination

**Gaussian Eliminaiton**

>**Goal**
>
>To transform a system of equations into an upper-triangular form (U) by creating zeros below the main diagonal
>
>**Pivots**
>
>The pivots is the first non-zero element in a row that is used for eliminaiton
>
>**The process**
>
>Use the pivot of a given row to eliminate the elments below it in the same column by subtracting a multiple of the pivot's row from the rows below it
>
>**Zero Pivots**
>
>A pivot cannot be zero. If a zero appears in a pivot position, a row exchange with a row below it is necessary to bring a non-zero number into the pivot position
>
>If no such row exists, elimination stops, and the matrix is proven to be singular

**Back-Substitution**

>**Augmented Matrix**
>
>form the augmented matrix [A|b]
>
>**The New System**
>
>After elimination, the original system Ax = b  is transformed in to an equivalent upper-triangular system Ux = c
>
>**Solving**
>
>The system is then solved from bottom up

#### 1.2 The Matrix View of Elimination

**Elimination Matrix**

>**Row Operations as Matrix Multiplication:**
>
>A row operation can be performed by left-multiplying the matrix A a specific "elementary matrix", denoted as E
