### 1.Definition

$$X \sim G(p)$$

>The Geometric distribution describes the number of independent and identical Bernoulli trails required to **achieve the first success**

### 2.PMF

$$P(X=k) = (1-p)^{k-1}p$$

### 3.Expectation


$$E(X) = \frac{1}{p}$$

### 4.Variance

$$D(X) = \frac{1-p}{p^2}$$

### 5.Properties

>* **Memoryless Property**: The probability of achieving the first success in the next few trails is independent of how many failures have already occurred
