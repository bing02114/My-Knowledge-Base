### 1.Orthogonal Vectors and Orthogonal Subspaces
#### 1.1 Orthogonal Vectors

**Definition**:

>"Orthogonal" is another word for "perpendicular". Two vectors are orthogonal if their dot product is zero

**The zero vector:**

>The zero vector is orthogonal to all vectors

#### 1.2 Orthogonal Subspaces and Complements

**Definition of Orthogonal Subspaces:**

>Subspace S is orthogonal to subspace T if every vector in S is orthogonal to every vector in T

**The Fundamental Orthogonality**

>The Row Space is orthogonal to the Nullspace
>
>The Column Space is orthogonal to the Left Nullspace

**Orthogonal Complements**

>The row space and nullspace are not just orthogonal; they are orthogonal complements in Rⁿ.
>
>This means the nullspace contains **all** vectors that are orthogonal to the row space, and their dimensions sum to n: `dim(Row Space) + dim(Nullspace) = r + (n-r) = n`.

#### 1.3 The Matrix AᵀA and Solving Inconsistent Systems

**Motivation**

>When a system Ax=b has no solution (often due to inconsistent data in "tall" rectangular matrices where m > n), we seek the "best possible" solution.

**The Normal Equation**

>The core of this method is to solve the related equation to find this optimal solution
>$$A^{T}A=A^{T}b$$

**Properties of ATA**

>* It's always a square matrix
>* It's always a symmetric matrix

**Invertibility of ATA**

- The matrix ATA is not always invertible.
    
- **Key Property:** The nullspace of ATA is identical to the nullspace of A: N(ATA)=N(A).
    
- **Condition for Invertibility:** ATA is invertible if and only if the nullspace of A contains only the zero vector, which means the **columns of A must be linearly independent**.

### 2.Projections onto Subspaces

#### 2.1 Projection onto a Line

**The Geometric Problem**

>$$a^{T}(b-p)=0$$

**The Projection Formulae**
![](images/projection.png)

>Since p lies on the line of a, we can write p=xa
>
>The Scalar Projection: $$x=\frac{a^{T}b}{a^{T}a}$$
>
>The Vector Projection: $$p = a\frac{a^{T}b}{a^{T}a}$$

 **The Projection Matrix P**

- We can express the projection as a matrix operation, `p = Pb`.
    
- **The Projection Matrix Formula:** $$P=\frac{aa^T}{a^{T}a}$$​.Note that the numerator is a matrix, while the denominator is a scalar.
    
- **Properties of P:**
    
    - The column space of P is the line spanned by `a`, and its rank is 1.
        
    - P is a symmetric matrix (PT=P).
        
    - Projecting a second time does not change the result (P^2=P).
