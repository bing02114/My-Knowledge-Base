### 1.Defintion

>A linear model is a function that attempts to learn a predictor through a linear combination of attributes

### 2.General Form

$$f(x)=w^{T}x+b$$

### 3.Interpretability

>Linear models have good comprehensibility or understandability because the weight vector w **intuitively** represents the importance of each attributre in the prediction
