### 1 Linear Independence, Basis, and Dimension

#### 1.1 Linear Independence

**Formal Definition**

>A set of vectors is linearly indenpendent if the only solution to the equation
> $$c_{1}x_{1}+c_{2}x_{2}+...+c_{n}x{n}=0$$ is $$c_{1}=c_{2}=...=c{n}=0$$

**Connetion to Matrices and Nullspace**

>If these vectors form the columns of a matrix A, they are linearly independent if and only if the equation Ax=0 has only the zero solution
>
>This means the nullspace contains only the zero vector

**Linear Dependence**

>Conversly, if there is a non-zero vector c such that Ac=0, the columns of A are linearly dependent

**Relationship with Rank**

>If the columns of A are linearly independent, then the rank of the matrix is r=n, and there are no free columns.
>
>If the columns are linearly dependent, the rank is r < n

#### 1.2 Basis and Dimension

**Spanning a Space !**

>A set of vectors is said to span a space if that space consists of all possible linear combination of those vectors

**Definition of a Basis**

>A basis for a vector space is a set of vectors that satisfies two properties:
>
>1. The vectors are linearly independent
>2. The vectors span the space

**Dimension**

>Every basis for a given space has the same number of vectors
>
>The number is the dimension of the space

**Basis for Rⁿ**

>Any set of n linearly independent vectors in Rⁿ forms a basis for Rⁿ.
>
>This is equivalent to saying that the nxn matrix formed by these vectors is invertible

#### 1.3 Bases for Column Space and Nullspace

For any given matrix, we can find the bases for its fundamental subspaces

**Basis for the Column Space**

>* The pivot columns of the original mamtrix A form a basis for its column space
>* The dimension of the column space is equal to the number of pivot columns, which is the rank r of the matrix
>* $$dimC(A)=rank(A)=r$$

**Basis for the Nullspace**

>* The special solutions to the equation Ax=0 form a basis for the nullspace
>* The dimension of the nullspace is equal to the number of free columns
>* $$dimN(A)=n-r$$

### 2 The Four Fundamental Subspaces

#### 2.1 Definitions of the Four Fundamental Subspaces

Column Space C(A)

>The space of all linear combinations of the columns of A. It is a subspace of 

Nullsapce N(A)

>The set of all solutions `x` to the equation Ax=0. It is a subspace of **Rⁿ**.

Row Space C(Aᵀ)

>The space of all linear combinations of the rows of A, which is also the column space of Aᵀ. It is a subspace of **Rⁿ**.

Left Nullspace N(Aᵀ)

>The nullspace of the transpose Aᵀ, which is the set of all vectors `y` satisfying ATy=0 or yTA=0. It is a subspace of **Rᵐ**.

#### 2.2 Finding the Basis and Dimension

- **Column Space C(A):**
    
    - **Basis:** The `r` pivot columns of the original matrix A.
        
    - **Dimension:** `dim C(A) = r` (the rank of the matrix).
        
- **Nullspace N(A):**
    
    - **Basis:** The `n-r` special solutions to the equation Ax=0.
        
    - **Dimension:** `dim N(A) = n - r` (number of columns - rank).
        
- **Row Space C(Aᵀ):**
    
    - **Basis:** The first `r` non-zero rows of the echelon matrix R (obtained from A through elimination). The row spaces of A and R are the same.
        
    - **Dimension:** `dim C(Aᵀ) = r` (the rank of the matrix).
        
- **Left Nullspace N(Aᵀ):**
    
    - **Basis:** The last `m-r` rows of the elimination matrix E (where EA=R). These are the rows that produce the zero rows in R.
        
    - **Dimension:** `dim N(Aᵀ) = m - r` (number of rows - rank).

#### 2.3 Deeper Insight and Justification

**The Key Principle**

>Elementary row operations do not change the linear dependence relationships among the columns of the matrix

**Consequence 1**

>Row rank = Column Rank

**Consequence 2**

>The rank is the "True Size" of a Matrix.
>
>The rank r reveals its true "effective" size-the number of truly independent rows and columns that define its essential properties

#### 2.4 Other Vector Spaces

The concept of vector spaces is not limited to Rⁿ

- **Example:** The set of all 3x3 matrices, M, forms a vector space.
    
- **Subspaces of M:** Examples of subspaces within M include the set of all upper triangular matrices, the set of all symmetric matrices, and the set of all diagonal matrices. The set of diagonal matrices is the intersection of the upper and lower triangular subspaces.

### 3 Transposes, Permutations, and Spaces

#### 3.1 Permutations and Transposes

**Permutations**

>**Purpose**
>
>Permutation matrices P are used to perform row exchange during elimination, which is necessary when a zero appears in a pivot position
>
>**The PA=LU Factorization**
>
>When row exchanges are needed, the LU decomposition becomes PA=LU 
>
>The permutation matrix P first reorders the rows of A, and then the resulting matrix is factored into L and U without further exchange
>
>**Peoperties**
>
>* Permutation matrices are obtained by reordering the rows of the **identity matrix**
>* For an nxn matrix, there are n! possible permutation matrices
>* A key property is that the inverse of a permutation matrix is its transpose $$P^{-1}=P^T$$

**Transposes**

>**Definition**: The transpose of a matrix A, denoted A^T, is formed by turning the rows of A into the columns of A^T,
>
>**Symmetric Matrices**: A matrix is symmetric if it is equal to its transpose
>
>**Transpose of a Product**: The transpose of a product is the product of the transposes in reverse order 
>
>$$(AB)^T=B^{T}A^{T}$$
>**An Important Property: For any matrix R, the product $$R^TR$$ is always a symmetric matrix**

#### 3.2 Vector Spaces and Subspaces

**Vector Spaces**

>**Definiton:**
>
>A vector space is a collection of vectors that is **closed under linear operations** 
>(vector addition and scalar multiplication). This means any linear combination of vectors within the space must also be in the space.
>
>**Key Property:**
>
>**Every vector space must contain the zero vector**

**Subspaces**

>**Definition:**
>
>A subspace is a vector space that is contained within a larger vector space.
>
>**Key Property:**
>
>A subspace must contain the zero vector. Therefore, a line or plane that does not pass through the origin cannot be a subspace.


#### 3.3 The Column Space as a Subspace

**Definition:**

>The column space of a matrix A, denoted C(A), is the subspace spanned by all linear combinations of its column vectors.
