### 1.Polynomial Interpolation

>1. The focus is on using polynomials as the interpolating function P(x)
>2. Existence and Uniqueness Theorem:
>	For any n+1 distinct points, there exists a unique polynomial of degree at most n that passes through all of them

***
### 2.Lagrange Polynomial Interpolation

>1. **Concept**: a direct method for constructing the unique interpolating polynomial
>2. **Formula**: The interpolating polynomial is written as a linear combination of the y-values
>3. **Pros and Cons**:
>	It's easy to write down the formula and understand from a theoretical perspective
>	It's computationally inefficient for a large number of points

### 3.Newton's Divided-Difference Interpolation

>1. **Concept**: An alternative and more computationally practical way to construct the same unique polynomial
>2. **Divided Differences**: They are typically calculated using a divided-difference table
>3. **Pros**: It's easy to add a new point without redoing the entire calculation

### 4.Interpolation Error and Runge's Phenomenon
#### 4.1 Interpolation Error
$$E(x)=f(x)-P(x)$$
#### 4.2 Runge's Phenomenon

> 1. Using a single, high-degree polynomial for interpolation over a large number of equally spaced points can be a very bad idea
> 2. The polynomial can exhibit wild oscillations near the endpoints of the interval, leading to very large errors.
> 3. This demonstrates the limitations of high-degree polynomial interpolation

### 5.Piecewise Interpolation and Splines
#### 5.1 Piecewise Linear Interpolation

>1. connect the data points with straight liens
>2. the resulting function are not smooth
#### 5.2 Spline Interpolation

>1. **Concept**: Use a series of low-degree polynomials on the subintervals between nodes, and enforces smoothness conditions at nodes where the pieces connect
>2. **Cubic Splines**: It ensures that resulting interpolation function, as well as its first and second derivatives, are continuous.
>3. **Boundary Conditions**: 
>	1. Natural Spline: The second derivative is set to zero at the endpoints
>	2. Clamped Spline: The first derivative is specified at the endpoints
