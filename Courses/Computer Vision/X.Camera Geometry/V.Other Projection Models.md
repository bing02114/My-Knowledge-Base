### 1.Orthographic Projection

* The full projection matrix P has **11 degrees of freedom** (5 from K, 3 from R, 3 from t).
* Projection rays are parallel to the optical axis
* **Properties:** Parallel lines remain parallel, and image size does not change with distance.

### 2.Weak-Perspective Projection

* A hybrid model that approximates perspective projection. It's equivalent to an orthographic projection onto a plane, followed by a perspective projection from that plane
* Accurate for objects that are small and distant from the camera.
