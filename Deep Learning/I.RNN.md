### 1.Definition

>A **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)** is a type of artificial neural network designed to recognize patterns in sequences of data, such as text, speech, or time-series data. Unlike standard feedforward networks, RNNs have a "memory" which allows them to use information from prior inputs to influence the current input and output.
>
>The defining feature of an RNN is its **recurrent loop**. This loop allows information to persist by feeding the output of a neuron back into itself for the next step in the sequence.
