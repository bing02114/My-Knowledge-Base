### 1.Definiton

>Boosting is a family of algorithms that can elevate a weak learner to a strong learner

### 2.Machanism

>It works by first training a base learner from the initial training set, then adjusting the distribution of training samples based on the base learner's performance, so that samples misclassified by the previous learner receive more attention in subsequent steps. This process is repeated, and the base learners are combined with weights
