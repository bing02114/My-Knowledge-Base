### 1. Row and Column Pictures

**1.1 The Fundamental Problem: The Geometry of Linear Equations**

>The fundamental problem of linear algebra is to **solve a system of n linear equations with n unknowns**

**1.2 The Row Picture: Intersection of Planes**

>In the row picture, each equation represents a line (2D) or a plane (3D)
>
>The solution to the system is the point where these lines or planes intersect

**1.3 The Column Picture: Linear Combination of Vectors**

>In the column picture, solving the system means finding the right linear combination of the column vectors of matrix A that produces the vector b

**1.4 The Question of Solvability**

>The key question is : for any given vector b, does the equation Ax=b always have a solution?
>
>A solution does **not** always exist. When this happens, the matrix A is called a <font color="red">singular or non-invertible matrix</font>

**1.5 Matrix-Vector Multiplication: Two Views**

>View1(Column): 
>
>**The product Ax is a linear combination of the columns of matrix A**
>
>View2(Row): 
>
>**The product Ax can be computed by taking the dot product of each row vector of A with the vector x**
