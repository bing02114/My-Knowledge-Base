### 1.Bracketing Methods
#### 1.1 Bisection Method

>1. **Concept**:
>	The interval is repeatedly halved
>2. **Properties**:
>	convergence is linear
#### 1.2 False Position Method

>1. **Concept**:
>	it uses the x-intercept of the straight line connecting the points
>2. **Properties**:
>	convergence is relatively faster than the Bisection Method

### 2.Open Methods
#### 2.1 Fixed-Point Iteration

>1. **Concept**: 
>	$$x_{k+1}=g(x_k)$$
>2. **Properties**:
>	Convergence is only guaranteed if the derivative < 1 near the root
#### 2.2 Newton's Method

>1. **Concept**:
>	$$x_{k+1} = x_k-\frac{f(x_k)}{f'(x_k)}$$
>2. **Properties**:
>	It has very fast quadratic convergence
>	However, it could get slower to linear convergence if it is near two same solutions
#### 2.3 Secant Method

>1. **Concept**:
>	$$x_{k+1}=x_k-\frac{x_k-x_{k-1}}{f(x_k)-f(x_{k-1})}f(x_k)$$
>2. **Properties**
>	Convergence is superlinear.

### 3.Convergence Analysis
#### 3.1 Order of Convergence

>$$lim_{k->∞}\frac{e_{k+1}}{e^p_k}=C$$
>1. **Linear**
>	p=1 and 0<C<1
>2. **Quadratic**
>	p=2 and 0<C<∞
>3. **Superlinear**
>	p>1
#### 3.2 Stopping Criteria

>1. check if the function value is close to zero
>2. check if the successive approximations are close to each other
