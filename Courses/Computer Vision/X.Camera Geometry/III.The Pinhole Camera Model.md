>This is the simplest camera model, where a 3D point is mapped to a 2D image plane by a straight line passing through a single point called the **Centre of Projection**

**Basic Projection Equations**

A 3D point (Xs​,Ys​,Zs​) is projected onto the image plane at coordinates (xi​,yi​) based on similar triangles

$$x_i=f\frac{X_s}{Z_s},y_i=f\frac{Y_s}{Z_s}$$

* Where `f` is the focal length (distance from the Centre of Projection to the Image Plane)
