### 1.Rotation Invariance

>The Harris detector is rotation invariant. Rotation of the image changes the eigenvectors of M, but the eigenvalues remain the same

### 2.Scale Invariance

>The detector is not inherently scale-invariant. The response to a cornor changes as the scale of the image changes. To achieve scale invariance, the detector must be applied across multiple scales
