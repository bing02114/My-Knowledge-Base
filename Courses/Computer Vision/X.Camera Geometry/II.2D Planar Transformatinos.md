>These are transformations that map 2D points to other 2D points on a plane. They form a hierarchy of increasing complexity

**Translation**

>Moves an object's location. Preserves orientation, lengths, and angles

**Euclidean / Rigid**

>Translation + Rotation. Preserves lengths and angles

**Similarity**

>Euclidean + Scaling. Preserves angles (shapes)

**Affine**

>Similarity + Shearing. Preserves parallelism of lines

**Projective**

>Affine + Projection. Only preserves straight lines
