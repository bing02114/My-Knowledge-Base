### 1.1 Review of Vector Spaces and Subspaces

**Vector Space**

>A collection of vectors that is closed under linear operations

**Subspace**

>A vector space that is contained within a larger vector space
>
>It must be subset and also satisfy the closure property for linear combinations

**Geometric Examples in R³**

>A plane P passing through the origin is a subspace of R³
>
>A line L passing through the origin is also a subspace of R³

**Operations on Subspaces**

>The union of two subspaces is generally **not** a subspace
>
>The intersection of any two subspaces is **always** a subspace

### 1.2 The Column Space

**Definition**

>The column  space of a matrix A, denoted C(A), is the space formed by all possible linear combinations of its column vectors

**Connection to solvability**

>The equation Ax=b has a solution if and only if the vector b is in the column space of A

**Dimensionality**

>For an mxn matrix, the column space is a subspace of Rᵐ, **because the column vectors have m components**

***
### 1.3 The Nullspace

**Definition**

>The nullspace of a matrix A, denoted N(A), is the set of all solution vectors x thay satisfy the homogeneous equation Ax=0

Dimensionality
