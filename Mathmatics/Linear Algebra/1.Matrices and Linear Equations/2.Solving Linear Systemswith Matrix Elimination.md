### 1. Matrix Elimination

#### 1.1 The Process of Elimination

**Gaussian Eliminaiton**

>**Goal**
>
>To transform a system of equations into an upper-triangular form (U) by creating zeros below the main diagonal
>
>**Pivots**
>
>The pivots is the first non-zero element in a row that is used for eliminaiton
>
>**The process**
>
>Use the pivot of a given row to eliminate the elments below it in the same column by subtracting a multiple of the pivot's row from the rows below it
>
>**Zero Pivots**
>
>A pivot cannot be zero. If a zero appears in a pivot position, a row exchange with a row below it is necessary to bring a non-zero number into the pivot position
>
>If no such row exists, elimination stops, and the matrix is proven to be singular

**Back-Substitution**

>**Augmented Matrix**
>
>form the augmented matrix [A|b]
>
>**The New System**
>
>After elimination, the original system Ax = b  is transformed in to an equivalent upper-triangular system Ux = c
>
>**Solving**
>
>The system is then solved from bottom up

#### 1.2 The Matrix View of Elimination

**Elimination Matrix**

>**Row Operations as Matrix Multiplication:**
>
>A row operation can be performed by left-multiplying the matrix A a specific "elementary matrix", denoted as E
>
>**Constructing E**
>
>**The Full Process**
>
>The entire elimination process that transforms A into U can be represented as a series of matrix multiplicaiton
>
>$$E_{n...}(...(E_{1}A))=U$$

**Permutation Matrices**

>A permutation matrix, P, is used to perform row exchanges. It is constructed by swapping the corresponding rows of an identity matrix
>
>**Left Multiplication: Swap the rows of matrix A**
>
>**Right Multiplication: Swap the columns of matrix A**

**Inverse of Elimination Matrices**

>The inverse of an elimination matrix performs the reverse operation

### 2. LU Decomposition of a Matrix
#### 2.1 Foundational Matrix Properties

**Inverse of a Product**

>$$(AB)^{-1}=B^{-1}A{-1}$$

**Transpose of a Product**

>$$(AB)^T=B^TA^T$$

**Inverse of a Transpose**

>$$(A^T)^{-1}=(A^{-1})^T$$

#### 2.2 A=LU factorization

**The Derivation**

>**From EA=U to A=LU**
>$$1.EA=U$$
>$$2.A=E^{-1}U$$
>$$3.L=E^{-1}$$
>$$4.A=LU$$

**The Advantage of L**

>A key advantage of the LU form is the similicity of L
>
>The multipliers used in each step of the elimination can be placed directly into the corresponding entries of L without creating complex cross-terms

**LDU Decomposition**

>The factorization can be extended to A = LDU, where D is a diagonal matrix containing the pivots

#### 2.3 Row Exchanges and Permutation Matrices

>If a zero appears in a pivot position, a row exchange is required
>
>**Row exchanges are performed by left-multiplying by a Permutation Matrix (P)**
>
>For an nxn matrix, there are n! possible permutation matrices
>
>this kind of decomposition is called PLU decomposition
>
>$$PA=LU,~where~P^{-1}=P^T$$
