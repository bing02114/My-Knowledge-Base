### 1 Linear Independence, Basis, and Dimension

#### 1.1 Linear Independence

**Formal Definition**

>A set of vectors is linearly indenpendent if the only solution to the equation
> $$c_{1}x_{1}+c_{2}x_{2}+...+c_{n}x{n}=0$$ is $$c_{1}=c_{2}=...=c{n}=0$$

**Connetion to Matrices and Nullspace**

>If these vectors form the columns of a matrix A, they are linearly independent if and only if the equation Ax=0 has only the zero solution
>
>This means the nullspace contains only the zero vector

**Linear Dependence**

>Conversly, if there is a non-zero vector c such that Ac=0, the columns of A are linearly dependent

**Relationship with Rank**

>If the columns of A are linearly independent, then the rank of the matrix is r=n, and there are no free columns.
>
>If the columns are linearly dependent, the rank is r < n

#### 1.2 Basis and Dimension

**Spanning a Space !**

>A set of vectors is said to span a space if that space consists of all possible linear combination of those vectors

**Difinition of a Basis**

>A basis for a vector space is a set of vectors that satisfies two properties:
>
>1. The vectors are linearly independent
>2. The vectors span the space

**Dimension**

>Every basis for a given space has the same number of vectors
>
>The number is the dimension of the space

**Basis for Rⁿ**

>Any set of n linearly independent vectors in Rⁿ forms a basis for Rⁿ.
>
>This is equivalent to saying that the nxn matrix formed by these vectors is invertible

#### 1.3 Bases for Column Space and Nullspace

For any given matrix, we can find the bases for its fundamental subspaces

**Basis for the Column Space**

>* The pivot columns of the original mamtrix A form a basis for its column space
>* The dimension of the column space is equal to the number of pivot columns, which is the rank r of the matrix
>* $$dimC(A)=rank(A)=r$$

**Basis for the Nullspace**

>* The special solutions to the equation Ax=0 form a basis for the nullspace
>* The dimension of the nullspace is equal to the number of free columns
>* $$dimN(A)=n-r$$

### 2 The Four Fundamental Subspaces

#### 2.1 Definitions of the Four Fundamental Subspaces

Column Space C(A)

>The space of all linear combinations of the columns of A. It is a subspace of 

Nullsapce N(A)

>The set of all solutions `x` to the equation Ax=0. It is a subspace of **Rⁿ**.

Row Space C(Aᵀ)

>The space of all linear combinations of the rows of A, which is also the column space of Aᵀ. It is a subspace of **Rⁿ**.

Left Nullspace N(Aᵀ)

>The nullspace of the transpose Aᵀ, which is the set of all vectors `y` satisfying ATy=0 or yTA=0. It is a subspace of **Rᵐ**.

#### 2.2 Finding the Basis and Dimension

- **Column Space C(A):**
    
    - **Basis:** The `r` pivot columns of the original matrix A.
        
    - **Dimension:** `dim C(A) = r` (the rank of the matrix).
        
- **Nullspace N(A):**
    
    - **Basis:** The `n-r` special solutions to the equation Ax=0.
        
    - **Dimension:** `dim N(A) = n - r` (number of columns - rank).
        
- **Row Space C(Aᵀ):**
    
    - **Basis:** The first `r` non-zero rows of the echelon matrix R (obtained from A through elimination). The row spaces of A and R are the same.
        
    - **Dimension:** `dim C(Aᵀ) = r` (the rank of the matrix).
        
- **Left Nullspace N(Aᵀ):**
    
    - **Basis:** The last `m-r` rows of the elimination matrix E (where EA=R). These are the rows that produce the zero rows in R.
        
    - **Dimension:** `dim N(Aᵀ) = m - r` (number of rows - rank).
