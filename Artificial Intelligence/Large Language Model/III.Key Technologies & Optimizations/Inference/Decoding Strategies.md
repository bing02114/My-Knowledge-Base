### 1.Greedy Search

>At each timestep, it simply selects the token with the highest probability as the next token in the sequence.

**Pros**

**Cons**

>It is myopic. It makes the locally optimal choice at each step, which may not lead to a globally optimal sequence. It often produces repetitive and generic text.
