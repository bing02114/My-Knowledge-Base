### 1.Joint Density Function

>Let (X,Y) be a random vector. If there exists a non-negative function $$f(x,y)$$ on $$\mathbb{R}^2$$
>such that for any rectangular set $$D = \{(x,y) | a < x \le b, c < y \le d\}$$
>in $$\mathbb{R}^2$$ the following holds:
>
>$$P((X,Y) \in D) = \iint_D f(x,y) dxdy$$

### 2.Marginal Density Function

>If $$f(x,y)$$ is the joint density of a random vector (X,Y), then the marginal densities of X and Y, denoted as $$f_{X}(x)$$ and $$f_{Y}(y)$$ respectively (also called marginal density), can be obtained by integrating out the other variableï¼š
>
>$$f_X(x) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x,y) dy$$
>$$f_Y(y) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x,y) dx$$

### 3.Independence

>Let X,Y have marginal probability densities $$f_{X}(x)$$$$f_{Y}(y)$$
>The necessary and sufficient condition for X,Y to be mutually independent
