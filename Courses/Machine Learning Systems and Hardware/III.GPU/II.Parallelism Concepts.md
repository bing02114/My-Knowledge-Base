### 1.Data-Level Parallelism (DLP)

>Performing the same operation on different pieces of data. This is exemplified by SIMD instructions

### 2.Instruction-Level Parallelism (ILP)

>Executing multiple instructions from a single program in parallel, used in modern CPUs

### 3.Thread-Level Parallelism (TLP)

>Executing multiple threads at the same time, a common feature in multi-core CPUs. GPUs aggressively exploit TLP to manage thousands of threads

### 4.Flynn's Taxonomy

>A classification of computer architectures. GPUs are a prime example of **SIMD** (Single Instruction, Multiple Data).
