Every vector remains unchanged                                                                                                             |
| Diagonal Matrix               | A square matrix where all non-diagonal entries are zero                                                                   | Represents a **pure scaling** (stretch or compression) along the standard coordinate axes.                                                                                                 |
| Triangular Matrix             | A square matrix with all entries below or above the main diagonal being zero.                                             | A combination of **scaling** and **shearing**. Its eigenvalues (scaling factors for eigenvectors) are its diagonal entries                                                                 |
| Tridiagonal Matrix            | A matrix where non-zero entries only appear on the main diagonal and the two adjacent diagonals.                          | Represents a "local" transformation, where the transformation of a basis vector only depends on its immediate neighbors. Common in numerical analysis.                                     |
| Permutation Matrix            | A square matrix with exactly one '1' in each row and column, and zeros elsewhere                                          | Represents a rigid transformation that **reorders (permutes) the coordinate axes**. It's a specific type of rotation or reflection.                                                        |

It has no rotational component.                                              |
| Positive Definite Matrix      | A symmetric matrix whose eigenvalues are all positive (λ>0).                                                              | Represents a pure scaling transformation with **no reflection**. It preserves the general orientation of vectors and defines an "upward-opening bowl"                                      |
| Positive Semi-Definite Matrix | A symmetric matrix whose eigenvalues are all non-negative (λ≥0)                                                           | Represents a pure scaling transformation with no reflection, but **may collapse space** into a lower dimension (if λ=0).                                                                   |
| Negative Definite Matrix      | A symmetric matrix whose eigenvalues are all negative (λ<0)                                                               | Represents a scaling transformation that reflects along all principal axes. Defines a "downward-opening dome" shape.                                                                       |
| Indefinite Matrix             | A symmetric matrix with both positive and negative eigenvalues.                                                           | Represents a transformation that stretches along some axes and reflects/stretches along others. Defines a **saddle shape**.                                                                |
| Invertible / Inverse Matrix   | An invertible (non-singular) matrix A is one for which an inverse A−1                                                     | An invertible matrix represents a **reversible transformation that loses no information**. The inverse matrix A−1 represents the exact transformation to **"undo" the action of A**        |
| Orthogonal Matrix             | A square matrix whose inverse is its transpose                                                                            | Represents a rigid transformation that preserves all lengths and angles. It is a pure rotation or a reflection.                                                                            |
| Projection Matrix             | A square matrix that is idempotent                                                                                        | Represents a transformation that **projects vectors onto a subspace**. Applying it more than once does nothing new.                                                                        |
| Hessian Matrix                | The matrix of second-order partial derivatives of a function. It is symmetric.                                            | Does not transform space, but describes the **local curvature** of a function's graph. Its definiteness determines if a point is a minimum (bowl), maximum (dome), or saddle               |
| Jordan Matrix                 | A nearly diagonal matrix composed of "Jordan blocks," which have eigenvalues on the diagonal and 1s on the superdiagonal. | Represents the "simplest" canonical form for _any_ linear transformation. Each Jordan block's action is a combination of **scaling** (from the eigenvalue) and **shearing** (from the 1s). |
