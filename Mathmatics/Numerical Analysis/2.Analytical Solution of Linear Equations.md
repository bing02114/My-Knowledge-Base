***
### 5. Error Analysis and Condition Number
#### 5.1 Vector and Matrix Norms

>Introduction to ways of measuring the "size" of vectors and matrices

#### 5.2 Condition Number

>1. **Definition**: $$cond(A) =||A||~||A^{-1}||$$
>	The condition number measures how sensitive the solution x is to small changes in the matrix A and the vector b
>
>2. **Well-conditioned System**
>	A small condition number. The solution is stable
>
>3. **Ill-conditioned System**
>	A very large condition number. The solution is sensitive to errors
