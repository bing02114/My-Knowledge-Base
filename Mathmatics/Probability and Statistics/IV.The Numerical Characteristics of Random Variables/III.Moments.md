### 1.Definition

Let X be a random variable, c be a constant, and r be a positive integer. Then $$E[(X-c)^r]$$ is called the r-th moment of X about the point c

### 2.Raw Moments and Central Moments

When $c=0$, $\alpha_r = E[X^r]$ is called the r-th raw moment of X

When $c=E(X)$, $\mu_r = E[(X-E(X))^r]$ is called the r-th central moment of X
