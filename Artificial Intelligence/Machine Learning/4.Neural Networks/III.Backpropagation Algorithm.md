### 1.Purpose

>The Error Backpropagation algorithm is the most successful neural network learning algorithm to data, used for training multi-layer networks

### 2.Process

>For each training example, the algorithm first performs a forward pass to compute the output, then a backward pass to adjust weights and thresholds.

* **Forward Pass**: The input is presented to the input layer and propagated forward through the hidden layers until an output is produced.
* **Backward Pass**: The error of the output layer is calculated, then this error is propagated backward to the hidden layer neurons. Finally, the connection weights and thresholds are updated based on the hidden layer errors.

$$v \leftarrow v + \Delta v$$

### 3.Overfitting Prevention

**Early Stopping**: Split the data into a training set and a validation set. If the training set error decreases but the validation set error increases, stop the training. 

**Regularization**: Add a term to the error objective function that describes the network's complexity (e.g., the sum of squares of weights and thresholds). This biases the training process towards smaller weights, resulting in a "smoother" output.
