### 1 Column Space and Nullspace

#### 1.1 Review of Vector Spaces and Subspaces

**Vector Space**

>A collection of vectors that is closed under linear operations

**Subspace**

>A vector space that is contained within a larger vector space
>
>It must be subset and also satisfy the closure property for linear combinations

**Geometric Examples in R³**

>A plane P passing through the origin is a subspace of R³
>
>A line L passing through the origin is also a subspace of R³

**Operations on Subspaces**

>The union of two subspaces is generally **not** a subspace
>
>The intersection of any two subspaces is **always** a subspace

#### 1.2 The Column Space

**Definition**

>The column  space of a matrix A, denoted C(A), is the space formed by all possible linear combinations of its column vectors

**Connection to solvability**

>The equation Ax=b has a solution if and only if the vector b is in the column space of A

**Dimensionality**

>For an mxn matrix, the column space is a subspace of Rᵐ, **because the column vectors have m components**

#### 1.3 The Nullspace

**Definition**

>The nullspace of a matrix A, denoted N(A), is the set of all solution vectors x thay satisfy the homogeneous equation Ax=0

**Dimensionality**

>For an mxn matrix, the nullspace is a subspace of Rⁿ, **because the solution vector x has n components**

**Important Distinction**

>The solution set to Ax=b in not a subspace. It does not contain the zero vector and is geometrically a line or plane that has been shifted away from the origin

#### 1.4 Two Methods of Constructing Subspaces

**Column Space:**

>Constructed "outward" by taking linear combinations of given vectors

**Nullspace:**

>Constructed "inward" by finding all vectors x that satisfy a specific condition

### 2 Solving Ax=0
#### 2.1 The Algorithm for Finding the Nullspace

>**The Goal:** 
>
>Find the nullspace of matrix A, which is the vector space of all solution x to the equation Ax=0
>
>**The Method: Elimination**
>
>**Key Principle:** 
>
>Performing row operations on A does not change the solution set of Ax=0 and thererfore does not change the nullspace

#### 2.2 Key Difinition from Echelon Form

>After reducing A to its echelon form U:
>
>* **Rank**: The rank of a matrix is the number of pivots
>* **Pivot Columns**: The columns that contain a pivot
>* **Free Columns**: The columns that do not contain a pivot
>* **Pivot Variables & Free Variables**: Variables in the vector x that correspond to pivot columns are pivot variables

#### 2.3 Constructing the Nullspace with Special Solutions

**Special Solutions:**

>The basis vectors of the nullspace. We find them by systematically assigning values to the free variables

**The process**

>* Set one free variable to 1
>* Set all other free variables to 0
>* Solve for the pivot variables using back-substitution
>* The resulting vector x is one special solution
>* Repeat this process for each free variable

**The Nullspace**

>The nullspace is the space of all linear combination of these special solution vectors

**Dimension of the Nullspace**

>The number of special solutions is equal to the number of free columns, which is <font color="Red">n-r</font>

#### 2.4 The Simplified Method - Reduced Row Echelon Form

**Difinition of rref (R)**

>All pivots are 1
>
>All entries above and below the pivots in the pivot column are 0

**The Structure of R**


$$
 R=\begin{vmatrix}
 I&F\\
 0&0\\
 \end{vmatrix}
 $$

**The Nullspace Matrix (N)**

$$
 N=\begin{vmatrix}
 -F\\
 I\\
 \end{vmatrix}
 $$

### 3 The Complete Solution to Ax=b

#### 3.1 Conditions for Solvability

**The Condition on b:**

>A solution exists if and only if b is in the column space of A, C(A)

**The Test:**

>This condition ca be tested using elimination on the augmented matrix [A|b]
>
>If a linear combination of the rows of A results in a zero row, the same linear combination of the components of b must also equal zero.

#### 3.2 The Structure of the Complete Solution

**The Formula**

>$$x_{complete}=x_{particular}+x_{nullspace}$$

**Finding a Particular Solution**

>A straightforward method is to set all free variables to 0
>
>Then, solve for the pivot variables

**The Complete Solution**

>$$x_{complete}=x_{p}+c_{1}x_{n1}+c_{2}x_{n2}+...$$

**Geometric Interpretation**

>The solution set is not a subspace.
>
>Instead, it is a plane of line that is parallel to the nullspace but has been shifted so that it passes through the point defined by the vector xp

#### 3.3 Rank and the Number of Solution

| Rank         | Solutions |
| ------------ | --------- |
| r = n < m    | 0 or 1    |
| r = m < n    | ∞         |
| r = m = n    | 1         |
| r < m, r < n | 0 or ∞    |
