### 1.Definition

$$X \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)$$

>The Normal distribution, also known as the Gaussian distribution, is a symmetric bell-shaped curve that describes data clustering around a central mean value.


### 2.PDF - Probability Density Function

$$f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma} e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}$$


### 3.Expectation and Variance

$$E(X) = \mu, D(X) = \sigma^2$$


### 4.Standardization

$$Y = \frac{X-\mu}{\sigma} \sim N(0, 1)$$

### 5.Properties

>**The Central Limit Theorem:** 
>It states that the sum of a large number of independent random variables will be approximately normally distributed, regardless of their original distribution
