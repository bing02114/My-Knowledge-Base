### 1.Errors
#### 1.1 Sources of Error

>1. **Modelling Error**: The error from simplifying a real-word problem into a mathematical model
>2. **Observation Error**: Errors in the initial data, often from measurements
>3. **Truncation Error**: Error caused by approximating an infinite process with a finite one
>4. **Rounding Error**: Error caused by the fact that computers can only store numbers with finite precision
#### 1.2 Measuring Error

>1. **Absolute Error**: The absolute difference between the true value and the approximation
>2. **Relative Error**: The absolute error divided by the magnitude of the true value
>3. **Error Bound**: The upper limit on the possible size of the error
#### 1.3 Significant Digits

>1. **Significant Digits**: Defining how many digits in an approximate number are trustworthy

### 2.Principles of Algorithm Analysis

#### 2.1 Stability of an Algorithm

>A stable algorithm is one where small errors in the input data do not cause the errors in the output to grow uncontrollably.

#### 2.2 Convergence

>1. describes whether the sequence of approximations is getting closer to the true solution
>2. **Order of Convergence**: How quickly an iterative method converges

#### 2.3 Computational Cost / Complexity

>An estimate of the number of operations an algorithm requires to run
