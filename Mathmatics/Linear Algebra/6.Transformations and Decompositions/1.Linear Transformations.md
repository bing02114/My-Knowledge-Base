### 1.Linear Transformations and Their Corresponding Matrices 

#### 1.1 The Concept of a Linear Transformation

**The Relationship Between Matrices and Transformations**

>**The Core Idea**
>
><font color="red">The most fundamental way to understand a matrix is to see it as the representation of a **linear transformation**.</font>

**Formal Definition and Properties**

>**Definition:**
>
>A transformation (or mapping) T is **linear** if it satisfies two rules for all vectors `v`, `w` and scalars `c`, `d`:
>
>* Additivity: T(v+w) = T(v) + T(w)
>* Homogeneity: T(cv) = cT(v)
>* T(cv+dw)=cT(v)+dT(w)
>
>**A Necessary Condition:** A consequence of these rules is that any linear transformation must map the zero vector to the zero vector: T(0)=0.

**Examples and Counterexamples**

- **Linear Transformations:**
    
    - **Projection:** Projecting a vector onto a line or plane.
        
    - **Rotation:** Rotating a vector by a certain angle.
        
    - **Matrix Multiplication:** Any transformation of the form T(v)=Av is a linear transformation.
        
- **Non-Linear Transformations:**
    
    - **Shifting the plane:** T(v)=v+v0​. This is not linear because it does not map the origin to the origin.
        
    - **Taking the length:** T(v)=∣∣v∣∣. This is not linear because it violates the homogeneity rule for negative scalars, e.g., T(−v)=−T(v).

#### 1.2 The Matrix of a Linear Transformation

**The Role of Bases and Coordinates**

- A linear transformation is completely determined by its action on a set of basis vectors. If you know how the basis vectors are transformed, you can determine the transformation of any vector in the space.
    
- The choice of a basis defines a coordinate system. A vector's coordinates are the unique coefficients in its expansion in that basis.

The Rule for Finding the Matrix A

- To represent a transformation T:Rn→Rm with a matrix A, you must choose a basis for the input space and a basis for the output space.
    
- **The Rule:** The **j-th column of the matrix A** is the coordinate vector of the transformed j-th input basis vector, expressed in the output basis.

#### 1.3 Correspondence of Operations

>Matrix operations correspond directly to operations on linear transformations.
>
>The product of matrices corresponds to the composition of transformations.
>
>The inverse of a matrix corresponds to the inverse transformation.

### 2.Change of Basis

#### 2.1 The Theory of Basis Change

**The Coordinate Transformation Formula**

- If `x` represents a vector's coordinates in an "old" basis (e.g., the standard basis) and `c` represents the _same vector's_ coordinates in a "new" basis, the relationship is given by `x = Wc`.
    
- Here, the columns of the matrix `W` are the new basis vectors, expressed in the old coordinate system.
    
- To find the new coordinates `c` from the old coordinates `x`, we compute `c = W⁻¹x`.

**Connection to Similar Matrices and Linear Transformations**

- A single linear transformation `T` can be represented by different matrices (`A` or `B`) **depending on the basis used for the coordinate system.**
    
- If `A` is the matrix for `T` in basis `v`, and `B` is the matrix for the _same transformation_ `T` in basis `u`, then `A` and `B` are **similar matrices**.
    
- The relationship between them is $$B=M^{-1}AM$$, where `M` is the change-of-basis matrix that converts coordinates from the `u` basis to the `v` basis.
    
- **A change of basis is simply a different way of describing the same vector or transformation within the same space.**
