### 1.Total Sum of Squares (TSS)

**Definition**

>TSS measures the **total variance** in the dependent variable (y). It represents the total amount of variation you are trying to explain with your model.

$$TSS = \sum^{n}_{i=1}(y_{i}-\overline{y})^2$$

### 2.Residual Sum of Squares (RSS)

>RSS measures the variance that is **left unexplained** by the model after it has been fit. It is the sum of the squared prediction errors (residuals).

$$RSS=\sum^{n}_{1}(y_{i}-\hat{y})^2$$

### 3.R-squared (R^2)

>R-squared, also known as the Coefficient of Determination, is the proportion of the total variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the model.

$$R^2=1-\frac{RSS}{FSS}$$
