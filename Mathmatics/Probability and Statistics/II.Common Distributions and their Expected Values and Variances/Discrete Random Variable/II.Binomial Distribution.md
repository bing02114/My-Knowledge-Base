### 1.Definition

$$X \sim B(n,p)$$

>The binomial distribution discribes the number of successes in a fixed number of independent and identical Bernoulli trails
>
>The probability of success remains constant for each trail

### 2.PMF

$$P(X=k) = C_n^k p^k (1-p)^{n-k}$$


### 3.Expectation

$$E(X)=np$$

### 4.Variance

$$D(X)=np(1-p)$$
### 5.Properties

>* **Additive Property**: The sum of two independent Binomial random variables with the same success probability is also a Binomial random variable
>
>* **When n is large and p is small, it can be approximated by the Poisson distribution with parameter Î» = np**
