### 1.Definition

$$X \sim Bernoulli(p)$$

>The Bernoulli distribution describes a single experiment or trail that has exactly two possible outcomes
>
>It is the simplest discrete probability distribution and serves as the fundamental building block for many others

### 2.Probability Mass Function

$$P(X=k) = p^k(1-p)^{1-k}, \quad k \in \{0, 1\}$$

### 3.Expectation

$$E(X) = p$$

### 4.Variance

$$D(X) = p(1-p)$$
