### 1. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
#### 1.1 The Core Concept

**The Defining Equation**

>$$Ax=\lambda x$$
>**Eigenvector**
>
>A non-zero vector `x` whose direction is unchanged when multiplied by matrix A. The resulting vector `Ax` is parallel to `x`.
>
>**Eigenvalue**
>
>The scalar `λ` that represents the factor by which the eigenvector `x` is scaled or stretched by the transformation A.

**Key Interpretations**

>**Eigenvalue of 0:**
>
>If 0 is an eigenvalue, then Ax=0x=0. The eigenvectors corresponding to λ=0 are the vectors that form the **nullspace** of A. This occurs if and only if A is a singular (non-invertible) matrix.

#### 1.2 The Calculation Process

**Finding Eigenvalues**

>**The Characteristic Equation**
>
>$$(A-\lambda I)x=0$$
>For this equation to have a non-zero solution for x, the matrix A-λI must be singular
>
>Therefore, we solve the characteristic equation: det(A-λ)
>
>The solutions to this n-th degree polynomial are the `n` eigenvalues of the matrix A.

**Finding Eigenvectors**

>Once an eigenvalue `λ` is found, its corresponding eigenvectors are the non-zero vectors in the **nullspace of the matrix (A−λI)**. This is solved using elimination.

#### 1.3 Properties and Special Cases

**Sum of Eigenvalues = Trace**

>$$\sum \lambda_{i}=tr(A)$$

**Product of Eigenvalues = Determinant**

>$$\prod^{n}_{i=1}\lambda_{i} = det(A)$$

**The shift property**

>$$if~Ax=\lambda x,~then~(A+kI)x=(\lambda+k)x$$

**Triangular Matrices**

**Symmetric Matrices**

>The eigenvectors of a symmetric matrix corresponding to distinct eigenvalues are always orthogonal. 
>
><font color="Red">Their eigenvalues are always real numbers.</font>

**Complex Eigenvalues**

>A real matrix can have complex eigenvalues, which always appear in conjugate pairs (if `a+bi` is an eigenvalue, so is `a-bi`).
>
>A <font color="Red">**rotation matrix**</font> is an example of a matrix with complex eigenvalues. The imaginary part of the eigenvalue relates to rotation.
>
>**1:If there are complex eigenvalues, then there must be rotation**
>**2:If there is rotation, then there might be complex eigenvalues**

**Repeated Eigenvalues**

>In some cases (called "**degenerate matrices**"), a repeated eigenvalue may lead to a "shortage" of linearly independent eigenvectors.


### 2.Diagonalization and Power of a Matrix

#### 2.1 The Concept of Diagonalization

**The Formula for Diagnoalization**

>**Condition**:
>
>A square `n x n` matrix A can be diagonalized if it has `n` linearly independent eigenvectors.
>
>**The Process:**
>
>1.Create the eigenvector matrix **S**, whose columns are the `n` linearly independent eigenvectors of A.
>2.Create the eigenvalue matrix **Λ** (Lambda), a diagonal matrix with the corresponding eigenvalues on its diagonal.
>
>**The Relationship**:
>
>These matrices are related by the equation AS=SΛ.
>
>**The Decomposition**:
>
>$$A=S\Lambda S^{-1}$$
>$$\Lambda=S^{-1}AS$$

**When is a Matrix Diagnoalizable**

>**Distinct Eigenvalues**
>
>If a matrix has no repeated eigenvalues (all `n` eigenvalues are distinct), it is guaranteed to have `n` linearly independent eigenvectors and is therefore diagonalizable.
>
>**Repeated Eigenvalues**
>
>If a matrix has repeated eigenvalues, it _might_ or _might not_ be diagonalizable.
>
>* **Diagonalizable:** The `n x n` identity matrix has the repeated eigenvalue 1, but it has `n` independent eigenvectors and is diagonal.
>* **Not Diagonalizable (Degenerate):** A matrix has a repeated eigenvalue of 2 but a "shortage" of eigenvectors (only one independent eigenvector), so it cannot be diagonalized.

**Spatial Meaning ! !**

><font color="Red">Essentially, the linear transformation represented by this matrix is just a pure scaling transformation along a set of 'special directions'</font>

#### 2.2 Applications of Diagonalization

**Calculating Powers of a Matrix**

$$A^{k}=S\Lambda^{k}S^{-1}$$

>**Eigenvalues of A^k:** 
>
>The matrix Ak has the same eigenvectors as A, and its eigenvalues are the eigenvalues of A raised to the k-th power (λk).
>
>**Stability:**
>
>If all eigenvalues of A satisfy ∣λi​∣<1, then as k→∞, Ak approaches the zero matrix.
