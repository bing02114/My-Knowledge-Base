### 1.1 Determinant and Its Properties 

**Definition:**

>The determinant is a numerical value associated with every square matrix. 
>
>The determinant of a matrix A is denoted as det(A) or ∣A∣. 
>
>**It compresses as much information about the matrix as possible into a single number.** 
>
>For example, a matrix being non-invertible (or singular) is equivalent to its determinant being zero. 
>
>Therefore, the determinant can be used to determine if a matrix is invertible.

**Properties**

1. det(I) = 1
2. The determinant changes sign when two rows are exchanged.
3. The determinant is a **linear function** of each **row** separately.
	1. **If you multiply one row of a matrix by a scalar `t`, the determinant is multiplied by `t`.**
	2. The determinant is **additive** in each row.
4. If two rows of a matrix are identical, its determinant is 0.
5. Subtracting a multiple of one row from another row does not change the determinant.
6. If a matrix A has a row of zeros, its determinant is 0.
7. The determinant of a triangular matrix is the product of its diagonal entries (the pivots).
8. A matrix A is singular if and only if its determinant is 0.
9. det(AB)=det(A)det(B).
10. det(AT)=det(A).

### 1.2 Determinant Formulas and Cofactors 

**The General Formula for the Determinant**

$$det(A)=\sum_{p\in S_n}(sgn(p))·a_{1,p(1)}a_{2,p(2)}...a_{n,p(n)}$$
**The Cofactor Formula**

>**Definiton of a Cofactor (Cij)**
>
>* The cofactor `Cᵢⱼ` of an element `aᵢⱼ` is its coefficient in the general determinant formula.
>
>* It is calculated as (−1)i+j multiplied by the determinant of the `(n-1)x(n-1)` matrix obtained by removing row `i` and column `j` from the original matrix.
>
>**The Cofactor Expansion Formula**
>
>$$det(A)=a_{i1}C_{i1}+a_{i2}C_{i2}+...+a_{in}C_{in}$$
### 1.3 Cramer's Rule, Inverses, and Volumes 

**Formula for the Inverse Matrix**

$$A^{-1}=\frac{1}{det(A)}C^{T}$$

$$A^{-1}=\frac{1}{det(A)}A^{*}$$
$$A^{-1}=\frac{1}{|A|}A^{*}$$
**Cramer's Rule**

>**The Rule**
>
>For a system Ax=b, the j-th component of the solution vector `x` is given by:
>
>$$x_j=\frac{det(B_j)}{det(A)}$$
>**Definition of Bj**
>
>For a system Ax=b, the j-th component of the solution vector `x` is given by:
>
>**Efficiency**
>
>While elegant, Cramer's rule is computationally much **less efficient than Gaussian elimination** for solving systems of equations.

**The Determinant as Volumn**

>**The Core Concept**
>
>The absolute value of the determinant, ∣det(A)∣, is equal to the volume of the parallelepiped (or parallelogram in 2D) formed by the row or column vectors of A.
