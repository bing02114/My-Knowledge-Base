### 1. Row and Column Pictures

**1.1 The Fundamental Problem: The Geometry of Linear Equations**

>The fundamental problem of linear algebra is to **solve a system of n linear equations with n unknowns**

**1.2 The Row Picture: Intersection of Planes**

>In the row picture, each equation represents a line (2D) or a plane (3D)
>
>The solution to the system is the point where these lines or planes intersect

**1.3 The Column Picture: Linear Combination of Vectors**

>In the column picture, solving the system means finding the right linear combination of the column vectors of matrix A that produces the vector b

**1.4 The Question of Solvability**

>The key question is : for any given vector b, does the equation Ax=b always have a solution?
>
>A solution does **not** always exist. When this happens, the matrix A is called a <font color="red">singular or non-invertible matrix</font>

**1.5 Matrix-Vector Multiplication: Two Views**

>View1(Column): 
>
>**The product Ax is a linear combination of the columns of matrix A**
>
>View2(Row): 
>
>**The product Ax can be computed by taking the dot product of each row vector of A with the vector x**

### 2. Matrix Multiplication and Inverses

#### 2.1 Matrix Multiplication

**Four Perspectives on Matrix Multiplication**

>**1. Standard Method (Row time Column)**
>
>The element in the i-th row and j-th column of C, cij, is the dot product of the i-th row of A and j-th column of B
>
>**2. Column Operation**
>
>The j-th column of matrix C is a linear combination of all the columns of matrix A
>
>**3. Row Operation**
>
>The i-th row of matrix C is linear combination of all the rows of matrix B
>
>**4. Column times Row (Sum of Outer Products)**
>
>The final matrix C can be seen as the sum of n matrices, where each matrix is the outer product of the k-th column of A and the k-th row of B

**Block Multiplication**

>If matrices A and B are partitioned into matching blocks, they can be multiplied block by block, similar to the standard method

#### 2.2 Inverses

**Difinition and Properties**

>**Invertible (Not-singular):**
>
>A square matrix A is invertible if there exists an inverse matrix A^-1 such that
>
>$$A^{-1}A=I=AA^{-1}$$
>**Singular (Not-invertible):**
>
>A matrix that does not have an inverse
>
>**Properties of Singular Matrices**:
>
>* The determinant is 0
>* The equation Ax=0 has a non-zero solution for x
>* Its column vectors are linearly dependent
>
>**Properties of Invertible Matrices**
>
>*
